# {program}`MATLAB` 2

This module continues the exploration of MATLAB and revisits concepts introduced
in Python that will now be used in MATLAB: logic, conditionals, and loops. 


## Topics Covered

- Logic
- Conditionals - if statements
- For loops
- While loops


## Pre-Requisite Knowledge for this Module

To be successful in this module, you should already know:

- How to perform mathematical operations in MATLAB
- How to create and save MATLAB programs
- Identify appropriate file and variable names in MATLAB


## Learning Objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Write appropriate logic statements in MATLAB
- Use conditional statements (if, elseif, else, end) statements to allow program flow
- Use for loops and while loops as repetition structures in MATLAB

These learning objectives are directly connected to the following Course Outcomes: 

- LO 1.1: Visually represent data and derive meaningful information from data. 
- LO 2.1: Contribute to team products and discussions.
- LO 3.1: Communicate engineering concepts, ideas, and decisions effectively and professionally in diverse ways such as written, visual, and oral. 
- LO 4.1: Develop code solutions that address engineering questions and follow professional programming standards. 
- LO 4.2: Understand and implement basic and intermediate programming structures: sequential structures, selection structures, repetition structures, and nested structures.
