```{admonition} Guidelines for Team Tasks
:class: note dropdown

- You should work with your classmates but remember that you and your team
  members will be held responsible for all material.

- You may work collaboratively with your classmates and even submit solutions
  that are similar as long as all of the collaborators are clearly listed, and
  their contributions are properly referenced.

- Each team is responsible for submitting their assignment to Gradescope. Team
  tasks will only need to be submitted by one member of the team. That team
  member will need to assign all the other team members to the submission.
