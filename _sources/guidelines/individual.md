```{admonition} Guidelines for Individual Tasks
:class: note dropdown

- You may seek help on individual tasks from classmates, the instructional team,
  or others but the work that you submit should always be your own.

- If you collaborate with others and use information developed together or by
  someone else, ALWAYS document and reference that material.
